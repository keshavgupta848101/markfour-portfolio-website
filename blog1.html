    <h1>Full-stack development 💻</h1>
    <p>this term in web dev means that you have a frontend application and a backend application when both work together
      its make a full-stack web application. both frontend and backend are stand-alone application that don't know that
      another application exist :( but then they talk through API “APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE”.</p>
    <h1>Frontend ✨:</h1>
    <p>The frontend is the view of the application when you go to “MYNTRA.COM” and whatever the interface you see its
      called the frontend that's built using Html, css, Js and a frontend library like react.
      Frontend application allows users to interact with the website and perform activities like navigating through
      pages browsing shopping websites and all</p>
    <h1>API 🔥:</h1>
    <p>When you type “BLACK SHIRT” in the search box and hit enter this is where API comes to the picture.
      Api takes BLACK SHIRT as a command and go to the backend and says “hey do you have BLACK SHIRT?” if the backend
      says yes I do have backend shirt it returns the BLACK SHIRT data in JSON format and the frontend process that data
      and shows you.</p>
    <h1>Backend 😎:
    </h1>

    <p>The terms frontend and backend describe the two primary parts of any website. In WordPress, the backend is
      proxies, and your website visitors usually won't be able to see these areas. It is visible only to administrators
      and registered users who have access to the admin area. The frontend is public-facing, and this is what users see
      when they visit your website.
